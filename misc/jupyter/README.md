# jupyter_notebook_config.py

Place this file in your ~/.jupyter folder to enable better version control
for your jupyter notebooks. With this configuration file every jupyter 
jupyter notebook save will push a .py version of your notebook to ./py.

For better jupyter notebook version control always have 1:1 dev:notebook.
Use your initials as a prefix for your notebooks (John Doe: `jd_filename.ipynb`).
